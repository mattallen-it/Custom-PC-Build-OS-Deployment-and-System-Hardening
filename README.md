![Completed Build](images/completed-build.png)

## Project Overview

Designed and built a custom gaming PC for an 8-year-old end user with the dual purpose of delivering a reliable, age-appropriate gaming system and establishing a documented, hands-on IT project.

The primary objectives of this project were to balance performance and cost, ensure long-term usability through future-proof component selection, and gain practical experience across the full system lifecycle. Emphasis was placed on hardware planning, system assembly, firmware configuration, operating system installation, troubleshooting, performance validation, and professional technical documentation.
